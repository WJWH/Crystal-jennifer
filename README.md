# activerecord-test

A test repo to play around with:
- The Jennifer ORM
- ECR templating

Since I'm only interested in those two things in this repo, don't expect tests or even basic safety features like HTML escaping.

## Installation

`shards install`, then `crystal run src/activerecord-test.cr` should do it.

## Usage

It'll start a server at localhost:3000, where you can then add posts. All posts added from anywhere will be displayed on the page.

## Contributing

This is just for playing around, I'm not looking for any contributors.

## Contributors
